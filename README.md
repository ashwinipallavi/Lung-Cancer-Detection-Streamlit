# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning & Streamlit

Early detection of lung cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project focuses on detecting lung cancer at an early stage using **machine learning and computer vision techniques** applied to medical images such as **CT scans**.

The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to analyze lung images and predict whether cancer is present. A **Streamlit web application** is built on top of the model to provide an easy-to-use and interactive interface.
